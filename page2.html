               Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document.
               The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system 
               that combines a system of numbers and letters to create
               thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black.

               To begin, we can change the

           <br>

           <font size ="3px">
                <b>
             header size

            and
           <font color="blue">

           <font color="green">

               vern on the scree. The

                   can be changed as well, and actually pres more choices.
           <br>
           <br>
                  We can aho change the appearance of words on the screen.
